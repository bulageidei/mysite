				<h3>Problem Solving</h3>
				<p class = "skill-description">During my studies in BE(Hons), I have also been working on personal projects such as designing and building an electric skateboard. Being constantly surrounded by problems, I have adopted the mindset of a problem solver. This allows me to come up with several solutions given a problem which I am then able to select the solution with the most rewarding yet smallest consequences.</p>
